Several years ago the possibility of creating a robot was only a dream, but nowadays with the development of new technology and the decrease of the price of this technology several new projects has been created ([Hansonrobokind](http://www.robokindrobots.com/),[Qbo](http://thecorpora.com/),[Nao](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/cool-robots/nao)…). All this projects have something in common, they are open projects and try to create a strong community around them. The companies offer a device with basic functionality and encourage the users to develop new software. Most of this devices are really useful for R&D but, from my point of view, it has a main weakness the high price of the item if you only are a hobbyist that enjoy technology.

Some example about successful low cost devices are for example [RaspBerry-Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [Hexy](http://arcbotics.com/).

Based on this idea, could be very interesting creating a small programmable biped robot whose main characteristic should be an affordable price based on open technology. For this purpose the objective is creating several posts where I will show the life of the project and will share all the necessary tools and diagrams to build you own robot. Of course this is a life project that I haven’t created yet so all the help and collaboration form the community will be really useful.
