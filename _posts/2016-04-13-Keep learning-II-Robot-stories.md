After long time without a proper learning course it is time to prepare the tools to learn robotic stuff as easy as possible. In this post I will show my next steps and I would like to organize all the things I would like to have time to learn.

In essence, the material treated in this course is a brief survey of relevant results from geometry, kinematics, statics, dynamics, and control.The course is presented in a standard format of lectures, readings and problem sets. There will be an in-class midterm and final examination. These examinations will be open book. Lectures will be based mainly, but not exclusively, on material in the Lecture Notes book. Lectures will follow roughly the same sequence as the material presented in the book, so it can be read in anticipation of the lecturesÔÇ¿ÔÇ¿.</li>

This course tries to summarize the related researches to artificial intelligence and robotics field. The students that take this course will learn to look at the engineering problems in a different way than the classical methods.
This course will also address to some extent how computer science and robotics can contribute to a better understanding of biological systems.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Conclusion</h6>
As you can see, there are plenty of courses you can join. There are courses made by university teachers and the only problem, for my, is that there are too much interesting courses and they are time-consuming. Please, let me know if you find other interesting courses.
