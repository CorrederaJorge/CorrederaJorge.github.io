The objective of this tutorial is installing a basic example of FreeRtos inside and Esp8266 12-E.  

<h2>Introduction </h2>
FreeRTOS is a popular real-time operating system kernel for embedded devices, that has been ported to 35 microcontrollers. It is distributed under the GPL with an additional restriction and optional exception. The restriction forbids benchmarking while the exception permits users' proprietary code to remain closed source while maintaining the kernel itself as open source, thereby facilitating the use of FreeRTOS in proprietary applications.

<h2>Installation process</h2>
First of all you have to install Esp Open Sdk. After that you have to compile and flash the program inside the Esp.

<h3>Installing Open Sdk </h3>
First of all have a look to  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-11-21-esp8266-openSdk %}" target="_blank">to this post</a> in order to install Esp Open Sdk.

<h3>Installing FreeRtos</h3>
More than installing is just downloading it from git and compiling/flashing to the Esp.

{% highlight bash %}
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Superhouse/esp-open-rtos.git
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
cd esp-open-rtos/examples/blink 
make flash
{% endhighlight %}

After that you would see:

{% highlight bash %}
esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 write_flash -fs 16m -fm qio -ff 40m \
