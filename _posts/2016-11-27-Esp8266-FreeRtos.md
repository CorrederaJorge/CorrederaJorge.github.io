The objective of this tutorial is installing a basic example of FreeRtos inside and Esp8266 12-E.  

<h3>Introduction </h3>
FreeRTOS is a popular real-time operating system kernel for embedded devices, that has been ported to 35 microcontrollers. It is distributed under the GPL with an additional restriction and optional exception. The restriction forbids benchmarking while the exception permits users' proprietary code to remain closed source while maintaining the kernel itself as open source, thereby facilitating the use of FreeRTOS in proprietary applications.
