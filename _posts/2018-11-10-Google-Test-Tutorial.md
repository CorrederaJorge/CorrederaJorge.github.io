The aim of this tutorial is showing how to use <a href="https://github.com/google/googletest" target="_blank">GoogleTest</a> to test your own projects in <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>.

The tests should be created in a different project so we are going to create a new project and then link the resources to this new project.

<h2> Creating new project </h2>

Create a new project in Eclipse. Just click on "File" -> "New C++ Project" -> "C++ Managed Build" ->

<h2>Install GTest</h2>

Go <a href="https://github.com/google/googletest" target="_blank">here</a> and download full project. Once it is done go to the folder where you have installed it and type:

{% highlight bash %}
cd googletest/scripts
./fuse_gtest_files.py pathToMyProject/googleTestLib
{% endhighlight %}

It will create all the Google test files inside the folder. Just take in account that the pathToMyProject changes to your path. 

After that let's set up the bulding configuration. First of all right click over the googleTestLib folder in Eclipse and select "Resource Configuration" -> "Exclude From Build..." and then select in the box "Release". 

The next step is again right click over the googleTestLib folder in Eclipse and select "Properties" -> "C/C++ Build" -> "Settings" -> "Cross G++ Compiler / Includes". In the "Include paths -I" you have to add the googleTestLib folder.  

<h2>Adding Tests</h2>

Add a new folder where you will add all the tests. Just create a new file and type:

{% highlight C++ %}
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

int main (int argc, char **argv) {
	:: testing:: InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
	return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
{% endhighlight %}

The ::testing::InitGoogleTest method does what the name suggestsâ€”it initializes the framework and must be called before RUN_ALL_TESTS. RUN_ALL_TESTS must be called only once in the code because multiple calls to it conflict with some of the advanced features of the framework and, therefore, are not supported. Note that RUN_ALL_TESTS automatically detects and runs all the tests defined using the TEST macro. By default, the results are printed to standard output. Listing 4 shows the output.
