This robots is the Darwin robot little brother. The good thing is that it is smaller and I think it would be much cheaper.

<h2>1) Description</h2>
I don't have too much information about it but I think Robotis will release all the information as they did before with the old Darwin version. At this very moment this robot will use Dynamixe XL-320 Servos with CM-904a driver board and LiPo batteries.

The revolution of this robot is the servo size. They are strong enough to handle the robot but the prize is much cheaper. Robotis hasn't release the product yet but the rumors says that it will be lower than USD$30. All the servo system would cost about ( USD$18 x 30 = USD$540) USD$600 that is much cheaper than the earlier version.

<strong>Dynamixel XL-320 Servo Specifications:</strong>

Weight- 16.7g
Dimensions- 24.2mm x 36mm x 24mm
Min Angle- 0.29 degrees
Gear Ratio- 238:1
Stall Torque- Approximately 4 kgf.cm (at 7.4V)
No load speed- Approximately 114 RPM (at 7.4V)
Operating Voltage- 6-8.4V (7.4V recommended)
Link (Physical)- TTL Level Multi Drop
Baud rate- 7843bps - 1 Mbps
Feedback- Position, temperature, load, input voltage, etc.
