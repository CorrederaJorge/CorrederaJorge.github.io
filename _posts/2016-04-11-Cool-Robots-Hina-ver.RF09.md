For those who don't know Japanese Hina means princess (neither do I). This robot it is a cute biped robot that is able to move and walk. In the next video you could see how the robot is able to move and make coffee. Of course it is not really true but who cares!!.

The good thing about this robot it is its size, it is able to move like and human and for me it is really cute. Someone said that it looks like <a href="http://www.pinky-street.com/index.php?page=mayura_album1&amp;img=1" target="_blank">pinky-street dolls</a>.

Mujaki Clockwork is the person who developed Hina and the specs are below:
Height: 36cm
Weight: 1.1kg
Servo: KRS-788HV GWS-PICO-STD
Power supply: 12volt Hobby Robot battery or mains supply
Control board: RCB-3J

I am afraid I have no more information because it is an old desing. Here you have some photos and a video how to make some coffee.
